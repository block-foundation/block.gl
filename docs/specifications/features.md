# Features

It would probably allow you to:

1. Visualize the Blockchain Structure: You would be able to see how a blockchain is essentially a linked list of blocks, each containing a set of transactions. The tool might show how each block includes a unique identifier (hash), the hash of the previous block (to maintain the chain), and the bundled transactions.

2. Simulate Transactions and Mining: The tool could let you simulate creating new transactions and adding them to blocks. It might also illustrate the process of mining – the way new blocks are added to the blockchain – and how this process involves solving a computational problem.

3. Demonstrate Security Features: The visualization could illustrate how altering a transaction in a block affects the hashes of subsequent blocks, demonstrating the blockchain's resistance to tampering.

4. Network View: It might include a network view to demonstrate how blockchain works in a distributed system, showing the spread of data across nodes and how consensus algorithms operate.

Blockchain Structure Visualization: A browser-native blockchain could have a visual component that represents each block and the chain linking them together. Each block would typically contain a list of transactions, a unique identifier (or hash), and the hash of the previous block to maintain the continuity of the chain.

Transaction Simulation: The blockchain might allow users to simulate creating and adding new transactions to blocks. This would likely involve inputting transaction details into a form, and the transactions would then be displayed in the corresponding block.

Block Creation and Mining: The blockchain could allow users to simulate the process of mining, which is how new blocks are created and added to the blockchain. This could involve running a proof-of-work algorithm in the browser, or it could be simplified to a button click for ease of understanding.

Immutability Demonstration: One key feature of blockchains is their resistance to tampering. The tool could show how, if you try to alter the data in a block, it changes the block's hash and breaks the chain. This effectively illustrates the concept of blockchain immutability.

Decentralization and Consensus Mechanisms: More advanced features might include a network view to show how multiple copies of the blockchain interact and stay synchronized. This could be used to demonstrate consensus mechanisms, which are how disagreements in the blockchain are resolved.
